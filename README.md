DSA-Problems is a structured repository focused on building strong problem-solving fundamentals using core Data Structures and Algorithms. This repository contains carefully selected LeetCode problems with clean, optimized solutions and clear explanations, aimed at strengthening interview-level DSA concepts.

The project covers essential topics such as Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, and HashMaps, with solutions organized topic-wise for easy navigation and revision. Each problem includes a well-defined approach, time and space complexity analysis, and readable code following best practices.

This repository is designed to:

Build a solid DSA foundation for product-based company interviews (MAANG-oriented)

Improve logical thinking and optimization skills

Serve as a quick revision guide before coding interviews

Act as a public proof of consistent DSA practice on GitHub

Tech Stack: Python (LeetCode-style solutions)
Level: Beginner → Intermediate → Hard
Goal: Interview readiness through consistency and clarity
